# met-api.project
This project i have practiced using API's and displaying its data. I've learned
a lot about how you can use fetch and how to dig deeper into the data with arrays
and keynames.

I've also created a memorygame. In my head from the start it seemed
like it wouldnt be too hard to create a memorygame, I managed to get quite far
without any help but when i had to type down the rules for the game i got stuck
until i found this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bznJPt4t_4s
which was of great help.
